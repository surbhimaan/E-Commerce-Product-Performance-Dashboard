### Description

In this project, I created a Power BI dashboard to analyze e-commerce data and gain insights into product performance and customer engagement. The process involved several key steps:

1. **Data Cleaning:** I began by filtering and structuring the raw data, ensuring accuracy and handling any missing values.
2. **Data Modeling:** Next, I established relationships between key metrics like SKU, sessions, units ordered, and product sales.
3. **Visualization:** Using Power BI, I developed interactive charts and graphs to visualize the data, focusing on top-selling products, customer engagement, and segment performance.
4. **Analysis:** I conducted a thorough analysis to uncover trends and correlations, such as how sessions impact sales and differences between B2B and retail segments.
5. **Recommendations:** Based on the analysis, I provided actionable insights to improve product strategies and enhance conversion rates.

The dashboard highlights top-performing products, reveals customer engagement patterns, and compares B2B with retail performance. This project aims to offer data-driven recommendations to optimize product strategies and drive business growth.

### Final Conclusion

In concluding this project, the Power BI dashboard has provided several key insights into e-commerce data. Here’s what I discovered:

- I identified the top-selling products and those driving the most revenue and units sold.
- The analysis revealed how customer engagement, such as sessions and pageviews, correlates with sales, and highlighted products with high engagement but lower conversion rates.
- Comparing B2B and retail segments showed distinct differences in performance, which could guide targeted strategies.

Based on these findings, here are my recommendations:

1. **Optimize Product Listings:** For products with high engagement but lower conversion rates, it’s important to enhance their presentation. Improving product descriptions, images, and promotions can help increase sales.

2. **Targeted Marketing Strategies:** Focus on products that perform well in the B2B segment by developing specific marketing campaigns aimed at this audience to maximize their potential.

3. **Improve Conversion Rates:** Develop strategies to better convert sessions into sales, such as refining pricing strategies or enhancing the user experience on product pages.

4. **Ongoing Monitoring:** Continuously track customer engagement metrics and adjust strategies based on emerging trends to stay responsive to shifts in consumer behavior.

By implementing these recommendations, the goal is to better align strategies with customer behavior, ultimately leading to increased sales and business growth.
